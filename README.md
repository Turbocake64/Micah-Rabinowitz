# Bootstrap-Portfolio


## (UPDATE!)

This is my updated Bootstrap Portfolio. I have included three assignments with links to gitHub in my portfolio and reorganized my three pages into one single page that toggles between the portfolio and about me section with a modal to substitute the contact me page. I took some liberty with the color scheme and, while the style isn't where I would like it, I have been inspired by some of my class mates' portfolio's and look forward to playing with some more css and js libraries to flesh mine out going forward. 


## Components Used:

* HTML
